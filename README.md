# Hospital Management System

This system, written in Python, primary objectives include managing patient medical records, storing patient contact information, and monitoring appointment schedules. A hospital management system involves three distinct user roles: administrators, doctors, and patients, each contributing significantly to the system's functionality. Patients can utilize the system to schedule appointments online, and these appointments are subsequently approved by administrators who also assign a doctor to the patient.
